# Symbolic regression
The aim of this project is to find a numpy formula that will map correctly a matrix of X to a vector of Y. <br>
The training data for 8 problems is provided in `data` folder. <br><br>

The search for the formula is done through genetic programming techniques. 
The proposed solution to tackling the problem can be found in `src`. <br><br>

The obtained results are reported in `s309608.py`, the training errors are provided in the comments.
